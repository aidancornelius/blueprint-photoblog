# README

A summer holiday project to re-create my photo blog in something other than Wordpress just to make sure I was still humanly capable of programming something. This is far from finished and by no means standards compliant. If you read the 
source you'll see a range of flags where things will go horribly wrong if you use this in prod. 

## System dependencies

### Ruby version

ruby 3.0.3p157

### Rails version

rails 7.0.4

## Other requirements
some kind of object storage (s3 compatible)
only using sqlite

### Configuration

very little to do

### Database creation

rake db:create

### Database initialization

rake db:migrate

### How to run the test suite

you're pretty funny.

### Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

yeah, I don't think so.

### Deployment instructions

Please don't use this at all, it comes with literally no warranty.

## License
